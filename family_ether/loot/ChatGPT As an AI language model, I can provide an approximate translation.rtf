\f0\b0 \cf0 I can provide an approximate translation of the given sentence into Babylonian using Akkadian, a language that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia and was written in cuneiform script.\
\
Unfortunately, Babylonian texts do not use personal pronouns in the same way as modern languages, so a literal translation of "I'm holy" is not possible. However, I can offer a version of the sentence that conveys a similar meaning and style:\
\
"\'9a\uc0\u363  \'9aarru. Ar\u7723 i\'9au il\u363 ti\'9aunu, il\u363 ti\'9aunu al\u257 ku, umma\'9aunu \'9aa\u7723 \u257 \u7789 u."\
\
Here's a breakdown of the translation:\
\
- "\'9a\uc0\u363  \'9aarru" means "I am a king." In ancient Mesopotamia, kings were considered to be holy, so this phrase conveys a similar sense of divine authority as "I'm holy."\
- "Ar\uc0\u7723 i\'9au" means "I am merciful." This word comes from the Akkadian root "ar\u7723 u," which means "to show mercy."\
- "il\uc0\u363 ti\'9aunu" means "to those who drink." This word comes from the Akkadian word "il\u363 tu," which can mean "drinking" or "feasting."\
- "al\uc0\u257 ku" means "to follow" or "to pursue."\
- "umma\'9aunu" means "to those who laugh." This word comes from the Akkadian word "umm\uc0\u257 tu," which means "laughter" or "joy."\
- "\'9aa\uc0\u7723 \u257 \u7789 u" means "quickly" or "suddenly."\
\
So, the full sentence could be translated as:\
\
"\'9a\uc0\u363  \'9aarru. Ar\u7723 i\'9au il\u363 ti\'9aunu, il\u363 ti\'9aunu al\u257 ku, umma\'9aunu \'9aa\u7723 \u257 \u7789 u."\
\
"I am a king. I show mercy to those who drink, to those who pursue, and to those who laugh suddenly."\

\f0\b0 \cf0 As an AI language model, I can provide an approximate translation of the given sentence into Sumerian, one of the earliest known written languages in human history. \
\
Sumerian is a highly inflected language and does not have personal pronouns in the same way as modern languages. Therefore, a literal translation of "I'm holy" is not possible. However, I can offer a version of the sentence that conveys a similar meaning and style:\
\
"lugal-an-na-ka. ab-ba-kam inim-ma-su-nu, inim-ma-su-nu ki-sikil-la, inim-ma-su-nu im-ma-ku-ud."\
\
Here's a breakdown of the translation:\
\
- "lugal-an-na-ka" means "you are a divine king." In Sumerian, the term "lugal" was often used to denote a divine ruler or king, and the suffix "-an-na" denotes divinity.\
- "ab-ba-kam" means "I am compassionate." This word is formed from the Sumerian words "ab" meaning "to show mercy" and "ka" meaning "I."\
- "inim-ma-su-nu" means "to those who drink." The word "inim-ma" means "to drink," and the suffix "-su-nu" indicates the third person plural, "their."\
- "ki-sikil-la" means "to those who follow the river." The word "ki" means "river," and "sikil-la" means "to follow."\
- "im-ma-ku-ud" means "to those who laugh quickly." The word "im-ma" means "to laugh," and "ku-ud" means "quickly."\
\
So, the full sentence could be translated as:\
\
"lugal-an-na-ka. ab-ba-kam inim-ma-su-nu, inim-ma-su-nu ki-sikil-la, inim-ma-su-nu im-ma-ku-ud."\
\
"You are a divine king. I am compassionate to those who drink, to those who follow the river, and to those who laugh quickly."\

\f0\b0 \cf0 As an AI language model, I can provide an approximate translation of the given sentence into Sumerian, one of the earliest known written languages in human history. Here's a possible translation:\
\
"ezen-imin-su-mu-ni, ninda-bi a-na-ke \uc0\u7827 id-da-ta. munus-bi-ka e-tar-ru-u\u7723 , ninda-bi-ka e-\u7723 u-ul-la-at."\
\
Here's a breakdown of the translation:\
\
- "ezen-imin-su-mu-ni" means "to those whom they admit." The word "ezen" means "to admit," "imin" means "to them," "su" means "they," and "mu-ni" is a suffix indicating third-person plural.\
- "ninda-bi" means "with a dry tongue." The word "ninda" means "tongue," and "-bi" is a suffix indicating possession.\
- "a-na-ke" means "to the desert." The word "a" means "to," "na" means "desert," and "ke" is a locative case suffix.\
- "\uc0\u7827 id-da-ta" means "their judgment is gentle." The word "\u7827 id" means "judgment" or "decision," "da" means "they," and "-ta" is a copula indicating the third-person plural.\
- "munus-bi-ka" means "their curse will follow." The word "munus" means "curse," "-bi" is a suffix indicating possession, and "ka" means "you" or "your."\
- "e-tar-ru-u\uc0\u7723 " means "in their sleep." The word "e" means "in," "tar-ru" means "sleep," and "-u\u7723 " is a locative case suffix.\
- "e-\uc0\u7723 u-ul-la-at" means "it will pursue them." The word "e" means "it," "\u7723 u-ul" means "to pursue," and "-la-at" is a suffix indicating the third-person plural.\
\
So, the full sentence could be translated as:\
\
"ezen-imin-su-mu-ni, ninda-bi a-na-ke \uc0\u7827 id-da-ta. munus-bi-ka e-tar-ru-u\u7723 , ninda-bi-ka e-\u7723 u-ul-la-at."\
\
"To those whom they admit, with a dry tongue to the desert their judgment is gentle. Their curse will follow them in their sleep, it will pursue them with a dry tongue to the desert."\
