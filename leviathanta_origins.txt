blue laughter, laugh at that cry, wind laugh and blow from the air through the air maker. Can I think of a snake drinking with me, hold my hand to restore the Holy Land. Leviathan only kicks in when skills become aggressive. There is no problem riding a magical dog on the ocean floor enough to fall in love. Make me stupid and happy and I pick up waves. Calm down, feel fear, hide my face, sail on the lost face dust, close the doors of lost twists and this twisted version of wolves and red bones. To build a house.

Dropping Leviathan is only if the skills become aggressive. No problem riding a charming dog on the ocean floor has never been enough to love you. Make me stupid and happy and catch the waves. I calm down, feel scared, hide my face, and sail on the dust of lost faces, wishes wasted, and close the gates of this twisted version of wolf and red bone. To build a house.
